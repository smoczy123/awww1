Overview. Object Pascal is a high-level, compiled, strongly typed language that supports structured and object-oriented design. Its benefits include easy-to-read code, quick compilation, and the use of multiple unit files for modular programming. Object Pascal has special features that support Borland's component framework and RAD environment.
