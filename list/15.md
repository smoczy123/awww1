SWIFT is a messaging network that allows financial institutions to send and receive information, such as money transfer instructions, securely and quickly. SWIFT assigns each member institution a unique code with a BIC number that identifies the bank name and the country, city, and branch. SWIFT is used for international payments and settlements, but it is not a financial institution.
